Caesar Cipher Tool - Task 1

Internship: Cybersecurity Intern @ Prodigy Infotech

This repository contains my first internship task at Prodigy Infotech, where I developed a simple yet functional Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption program using Python.

üîê What is the Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. It's one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers.

For example, with a shift of 3:

A becomes D

B becomes E

X becomes A

‚öôÔ∏è Features

Text encryption using a user-defined shift

Text decryption using the reverse shift

Interactive command-line interface

Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters

Leaves non-alphabet characters unchanged

üìÇ File

caeser_cipher.py : Main Python file containing the Caesar Cipher logic and user interface

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Soumili-Dey/PRODIGY_CS_01.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd PRODIGY_CS_01

Run the script:

python caeser_cipher.py

üåü Example

Enter your choice (1/2/3): 1
Enter the message to encrypt: Hello World!
Enter the shift value (1-25): 3
Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog!

üöÄ Future Scope

Extend support for numeric and special character encryption

Add GUI using Tkinter or PyQt

Implement brute-force decryption for unknown shift
